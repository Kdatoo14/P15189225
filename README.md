<h1> READ ME </h1>
Welcome to my website. i have a very bug interest in street fashion and urban wear so i decided to create my site based on this.
first i drew up a simple design so that i could get a picture of the layout i wanted to make, the sketches are as shown below.(located in the image file if cannot be seen)
<img src = "images/design1">
<img src = "images/design2">
there was a few things that went wrong firstly the navigation bar would not and still will not centre, i had tried many ways to change this but i could not solve this issue. however i have a feeling its something to do with my CSS. if i had more time i would go through it line by line to see if i could fix the issue.
another problem that i couldn't resolve, is that the slideshows that i have added wont start on their own and are hidden until clicked. once clicked it then begins to work correctly.
i also had a few issues with alignment and creating the initial layout, but with a little help from my friends and a lot of googling and youtube tutorials i managed to make a website that i was more that happy with even with these current issues.
i had tested all the java script and new sections of the site as i created them, i also validated my code and corrected as many errors as i could without ruining the integrity of the site.
